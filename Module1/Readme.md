## The first module includes scripts to first overview R features and then introduce the basics 
To include variables, data structures and types, and basic functionality for statistics and analysis. Reading notes are *direct comments in the scripts*.

  1. ***Script1_Overview***: This is just an overview of R from basic math to variables to an actual plot. It is meant to run on CLI.
  2. ***Script2_LoadPackage***: This is the first full script (can still run on CLI). Which shows how to load a package in R.
